## CURRENT STATUS

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | **PLANNING COMPLETE - NO CODE WRITTEN - NO PROVIDER SELECTED** |
| **Next action** | Two things, in this order: **decide the scenario** (below), then commercial - find and assess a provider using `08` |
| **Blocked by** | Stage 0 always. In the add-on scenario also Phase 1 of the `New games plan`. Plus a signed provider |
| **Owner instruction on record** | Plan only. Nothing to be built until explicitly asked (18 Aug 2026) |
| **Last updated** | 1 September 2026 |

**Nothing in the application has been changed by this project.**

**But Stage 0 has started** (1 September 2026), and it is the prerequisite for *both*
scenarios. Progress on it is tracked in `New games plan/PROGRESS.md`, not here. Two things
from it change facts stated in this folder:

- A live security defect was found and shipped as **Prerequisite A** (commit `d5d3a328`):
  the `/api/simulator/*` routes accepted a plain request header as authentication in
  production. Recorded here as **R27** in `17-risk-register.md`, because this programme adds
  a provider webhook and the same class of mistake is available there.
- Re-verification corrected four facts this folder restates from the `New games plan`. The
  mirror count is **75 pairs with 11 drifted**, not ~21 with 3; the finalize-time safeguard
  does **not** mask the prize-pool gap; there are **four** competition-entry writers; and the
  challenge *accept* path skips restriction and fraud checks on a route real players use.
  `17-risk-register.md` R1 and R2 and `18-migration-testing-rollout.md` section 2 have been
  updated. **Stage 0 is now 6-9 days, not 5-8.**
- **Stage 0 Defect 2 (model mirrors) is built** as of 1 September 2026, and it changed a
  load-bearing fact this folder repeats. Drift is a **write-side** defect, measured against
  a real MongoDB rather than assumed. An ordinary `save()` does **not** strip undeclared
  fields, and `.lean()` and `toObject()` do **not** hide them - both earlier claims were
  wrong. What actually happens: a **missing enum value rejects the write**, and the
  narrower app **cannot write the field at all**, silently, while reporting success.

  One read *does* break, and it is the one application code uses: **ordinary `doc.field`
  access returns `undefined`**, because Mongoose defines getters only for declared paths.
  So a drifted field survives a debug dump intact while the code beside it reads nothing
  and takes the wrong branch. Assume nothing from a read; run `npm run check:mirrors`.

  **This matters more to this programme than to the in-house one.** Provider integration
  introduces exactly the enum that breaks this way - the four terminal round statuses in
  `01-provider-contract-specification.md` (`completed`, `abandoned`, `expired`, `voided`).
  A copy missing one of them **rejects the result callback** rather than mis-storing it, so
  a finished round is never recorded and the contest never settles. The guard
  (`tools/model-mirror/`) compares enum values for this reason.
- **Stage 0 Defect 1 (entry paths) is built** as of 1 September 2026. All four competition
  entry writers are resolved: two became wrappers over `lib/services/contest-entry.service.ts`,
  the simulator batch route was fixed in place, and the dead admin copy was deleted. R1 in
  `17-risk-register.md` is updated. Three things from it bear on this programme directly:

  **The single entry service is the seam every provider contest will join through.** That was
  the point of doing it first, and it now exists: one place that takes a fee, funds the pool,
  seats the player and runs the fraud controls. A provider adapter adds a caller, not a fifth
  implementation.

  **A constraint on how that seam may refuse anyone, added 2 September 2026.** Prerequisite B
  in `New games plan/00a` fixed an owner-reported live incident: the fraud gate was refusing
  paid entry on a player's **suspicion score alone**, creating no restriction - so the block
  showed on no admin screen, notified nobody, could not be lifted, and happened while
  automatic suspension was switched off. **Scores raise alerts; restrictions block.** When X5
  extends the fraud controls to provider entries, automatic enforcement goes through
  `UserRestriction` and never through a bare refusal inside the gate. This matters more here
  than anywhere it has been tested: a provider contest is cheaper and faster to enter than a
  trading contest, so it will trip a throttle far more often, and the false-positive rate this
  rule protects against is correspondingly higher. R9 and R27 in `17-risk-register.md` are
  updated - R27 because that investigation found a **third** route asserting an authorization
  check it never performed, this time letting any signed-in player raise a rival's fraud score.

  **Two things it fixed are hazards this programme would have re-created.** The prize pool is
  now incremented on every path - a provider contest seeded by an internal route would
  otherwise have repeated the exact defect. And the read-then-insert seat race is handled:
  two entries for one player collide on the unique index and report **duplicate key 11000,
  not a write conflict**, so it sits outside any retry loop. Provider integration multiplies
  concurrent entries; assume this will be hit.

  **The two items previously open here are now closed**, both on 1 September 2026. Challenge
  accept has the restriction and fraud gates, sharing `checkAccountStanding` with the entry
  service so the two paths cannot drift apart again. The `SuspicionScore` races are fixed -
  and **R28 records two corrections worth reading before writing provider code**: there were
  five call sites, not three, and fixing the read-then-create exposed a *second* race in the
  same function, where `totalScore` was read-modify-written and clobbered under concurrency.

  A third defect was found while documenting the first: `challengeId` was declared on
  **neither** `WalletTransaction` copy, so **nine** writers - challenge entry, the decline
  refund, and six finalization payouts across both apps - had it silently discarded. **The
  whole challenge money trail was unattributable.** Fixed add-only in both copies. Two points
  carry directly into provider work: no balance was wrong, so describe it as an audit-trail
  fault rather than a financial one; and **the mirror guard could not have caught it**,
  because both copies were wrong identically. A green `check:mirrors` proves the two apps
  agree with each other, never that either agrees with the code writing to them.

### THE OPEN DECISION - which scenario

| Scenario | Meaning | Programme | Documents |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Add-on** | The `New games plan` is delivered too - foundation, an in-house game, all platform work. External games are an addition | E1-E9, **7.5-8 weeks** engineering on top | `01`-`09` |
| **External-only** | **Provider games are the only new games.** No in-house game | X0-X12, **20-26 weeks** total | `01`-`09` **and** `10`-`18` |

**Not yet decided.** Record the answer here when it is.

The finding that should drive the decision: **external-only is not cheaper, it is
broader.** Dropping the in-house game saves ~3.5 weeks; the provider integration costs
~7. Every platform-wide change (admin, navigation, wording, flags, catalogue) is
identical either way. What the external route buys is a catalogue of many games and no
content burden, at the cost of ~6 extra weeks, a per-round or revenue-share fee, and a
single supplier on the critical path. Full reasoning in `10` sections 2 and 5.

## DOCUMENT SYNC RULE - APPLIES FROM THE MOMENT BUILDING STARTS

> **Documentation is part of the deliverable, not a follow-up task.** A phase is not
> finished until these documents match what was actually built.

Also enforced by `.cursor/rules/games-plan-docs-sync.mdc`, which loads automatically
in every session.

Whenever implementation happens, or any new information changes an assumption:

1. **Update this file** - status table, decisions, open questions, and a work-log entry.
2. **Update the affected chapter.** Data model changed? `04`. Flow changed? `03`.
   Security changed? `06`.
3. **Update both HTML versions**, which drift silently because nothing compiles them:
   - `ChartVolt-External-Games-Plan.html` - internal, illustrated
   - `ChartVolt-Game-API-Requirements.html` - **sent to game providers**
4. **Record deviations explicitly** in the work log, with the reason. Never silently
   rewrite the plan to match the code - the gap between them is the useful information.
5. **Check documents outside this folder**: `New games plan/PROGRESS.md`, the root
   `README.md`, `deploy/README.md`, the admin wiki
   (`apps/admin/components/admin/AdminWikiSection.tsx`), and
   `legal/ChartVolt-Regulatory-Defence-Pack.html` if anything touches the
   skill-versus-chance argument or the money flow.

### The paired documents that must never drift

| Pair | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `01-provider-contract-specification.md` and `ChartVolt-Game-API-Requirements.html` | Same requirements, different audience. **A provider building against a stale spec is worse than no spec**, because both sides believe they agree |
| Any model change | Every model exists twice - `database/models/` and `apps/admin/database/models/`. Same commit, always |

If a provider negotiates a deviation from the specification, it is recorded in **both**
of those documents and in the decision log below.

---

## THE PLAN IN FIVE LINES

An external company supplies skill games - chess puzzles, trivia, word games. They
run the gameplay and report a **score per player**. ChartVolt does everything else,
exactly as it does for trading today: entry fees, prize pool, ranking, prizes,
points, badges, levels.

**The provider never touches money.** That single boundary is what makes this
project low risk.

---

## START HERE NEXT

This plan has two tracks, and the commercial one is currently the blocker.

### Track A - commercial (blocking, no engineering needed)

1. Identify candidate skill-game providers.
2. Send them Gate 1 from `08-provider-evaluation-checklist.md`. Ten questions,
   answerable in one email, and they eliminate most candidates immediately.
3. Send `01-provider-contract-specification.md` to anyone who passes.
4. Score them with Gate 2. Settle **pricing** before any build - see the per-round
   arithmetic in `08` section 3.

Three more questions belong in the same conversation, because each one changes the
engineering plan:

5. Will the provider supply **game page content** - description, rules, how-to-play,
   artwork, localised? It is contractual in `01` section 3.1. A refusal transfers that
   cost to us per title, forever (risk **X5**).
6. Is there a **committed date for sandbox access**? Nothing after X4 can be built
   without it (risk **X1**).
7. Will a **second provider** be evaluated before launch? The adapter boundary only makes
   replacement cheap if it is exercised (risks **X2** and **X6**).

### Track B - engineering

**Add-on scenario** - blocked by the `New games plan`:

1. **Stage 0** - `New games plan/00a`. Two live defects under the contest and money layer.
2. **Phase 1** - `New games plan` game-module foundation.
3. Then **E1** of `09-implementation-phases.md`, which proceeds against a mock adapter
   with no provider at all.

**External-only scenario** - self-contained, per `10` section 3:

1. **X0** - Stage 0 defect fixes. Still a prerequisite; still needs owner sign-off.
2. **X1** - the foundation, now owned by this plan. See `11`.
3. **X2** - provider abstraction and mock adapter. No provider needed.

**Do not start Track B engineering before Stage 0 / X0 is signed off**, in either scenario.

## STATUS TABLE

Legend: `NOT STARTED` / `IN PROGRESS` / `BUILT - AWAITING OWNER TEST` / `SIGNED OFF`

### Add-on scenario - E-phases

| Phase | Description | Estimate | Status | Signed off |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Prereq** | Stage 0 defect fixes (`New games plan/00a`) | 6-9 days | `IN PROGRESS` - Prereq A shipped 1 Sep 2026 | - |
| **Prereq** | Phase 1 game-module foundation (`New games plan`) | 2-3 weeks | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **Prereq** | Provider selected and contracted | - | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **E1** | Provider abstraction + mock adapter | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **E2** | Round lifecycle + result ingestion | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **E3** | Real adapter against sandbox | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **E4** | Contest integration + settlement | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **E5** | Admin panel | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **E6** | Player UI + rewards | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **E7** | Resilience, reconciliation, monitoring | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **E8** | Challenges | 0.5-1 week | `NOT STARTED` | - |
| **E9** | Pilot and launch | 2-4 weeks | `NOT STARTED` | - |

**Hard ordering:** Stage 0 -> Phase 1 -> E1 -> E2 -> everything else.
E1 and E2 need no provider. E3 onward needs sandbox credentials.

### External-only scenario - X-phases (`10` section 3)

| Phase | Description | Source | Estimate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **X0** | Prerequisite defect fixes, owner sign-off | `New games plan/00a` | 6-9 days | `IN PROGRESS` - Prereq A shipped 1 Sep 2026 |
| **X1** | Foundation: game label, score, registry, four seams, **GM insert game label** | `11` + `19` s3.1 | 2.5-3.5 weeks | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X2** | Provider abstraction + mock adapter | `09` E1 | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X3** | Round lifecycle + result ingestion | `09` E2 | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X4** | Real adapter against sandbox | `09` E3 | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X5** | Contest integration + settlement | `09` E4 | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X6** | Admin: provider screens + nav, RBAC, wizard, analytics, **GM creation API + wizard** | `09` E5 + `12` + `19` | 3-3.5 weeks | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X7** | Player UI + points, leaderboards, badges, levels, **per-game GM analytics** | `09` E6 + `13` + `05` + `19` | 3-4 weeks | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X8** | Terminology, `tradingEnabled`, infrastructure gating | `14` + `15` | 1.5-2 weeks | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X9** | Resilience, reconciliation, monitoring | `09` E7 | 1 week | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X10** | Challenges | `09` E8 | 0.5-1 week | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X11** | Games catalogue + games-first navigation | `16` | ~2 weeks | `NOT STARTED` |
| **X12** | Hardening, staged pilot, public launch | `09` E9 + `18` | 3-5 weeks | `NOT STARTED` |
| Later | Per-game marketplace | `16` s2 | ~2 weeks | `NOT SCHEDULED` |

**Game Master work is not a separate phase.** It is distributed: the game label on both
Game Master competition inserts is a **gate inside X1**, the creation API and UI land in
X6, analytics in X7, tier wording in X8. Total ~2.5 weeks, all inside the figures above.
See `19`.

**X1-X12: 20-26 weeks**, plus X0 separately. **The shortest useful path is X0-X5 plus a
minimal slice of X6 - nine to eleven weeks of engineering, 11-14 in calendar terms**
because X4 onward waits on sandbox access. It produces a provider contest a player can pay
for and play, and that is the right place to pause and review against real behaviour.

**Three gates** govern progress: Gate 1 before X1, Gate 2 before X5, Gate 3 before the
X12 pilot. All three are in `17` section 7.

## DECISIONS ON RECORD

| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| 18 Aug 2026 | **The provider never handles money** | Removes wallet integration, third-party balance access, and most of the financial risk |
| 18 Aug 2026 | **One game module for all provider games**, with the specific game held as data | A new title from an existing provider needs no code change or release |
| 18 Aug 2026 | **`gameKey` is the statistics key and is immutable** | Historical leaderboards, ratings and badges must never move |
| 18 Aug 2026 | **Launch with independent-play games only** | Head-to-head games need a bracket engine for competitions. Chess puzzles give us chess without one |
| 18 Aug 2026 | **Content seeding is mandatory for competitions** | Without identical content there is no fair ranking, and the regulatory position weakens |
| 18 Aug 2026 | **Default attempts policy is `single`; attempts consumed at creation** | Blocks the abandon-and-peek exploit and caps per-round provider cost |
| 18 Aug 2026 | **Only skill-based games are in scope** | Chance-determined outcomes would supply the missing element of the gambling test and invert the platform's regulatory position |
| 18 Aug 2026 | Plan written **provider-neutral** | No provider chosen. `01` doubles as our requirements document and our evaluation checklist |
| 30 Aug 2026 | Platform becomes **games-first**; trading is one game among several | Owner direction. Recorded in `New games plan/15-platform-transformation-and-gaps.md`. An external provider game becomes a **catalogue entry** with its own game page, so `provider_game` fields feed the catalogue content model |
| 30 Aug 2026 | Marketplace items may **never** affect score or ranking; no random packs | Fairness, the regulatory position, and chargeback exposure. Applies to provider games too, so never buy a provider feature that sells in-game advantage |
| 30 Aug 2026 | **Page content per game is contractual, not optional** - tagline, description, rules summary, how-to-play, banner artwork, localised, unbranded | Each provider title gets its own game page. Writing that copy per title in every language is cheap for the provider and expensive for us. A provider unwilling to supply it is transferring their content cost to us, per title, forever. Raise in commercial discussion, not after signing |
| 30 Aug 2026 | **This folder must stand alone if external games are the only games** | Chapters `01`-`09` delegated the foundation and every platform-wide change to the `New games plan`. If that plan is not delivered, the dependency does not disappear - it moves here. Chapters `10`-`18` added to own it |
| 30 Aug 2026 | **External-only is not the cheaper route; it is the broader one** | Dropping the in-house game saves ~3.5 weeks. A correct provider integration costs ~7. Every platform-wide change is identical either way. 20-26 weeks against 12-17. The prize is a catalogue and no content burden, not a saving - and it must not be presented internally as one |
| 30 Aug 2026 | **Stage 0 is a prerequisite in every scenario** | It fixes live defects under the money layer - divergent join paths and admin mirror drift. No plan can skip it, and no scenario changes that |
| 30 Aug 2026 | **The shortest useful commitment is X0-X5 plus a minimal X6** | Nine to eleven weeks of engineering, 11-14 in calendar terms, and it produces a provider contest a player can pay for and play. Reviewing there against real behaviour is the defence against R24 in a 20-26 week programme |
| 30 Aug 2026 | **No paid format is ever single-player.** Competition means two or more; challenge means exactly two | Owner clarification, after "independent play" was read as "solo contest". `minParticipants` already defaults to 2 and already auto-cancels with refunds below it, so this is reused rather than built. `03` section 0 states it before anything else |
| 30 Aug 2026 | **"Independent play" replaces "solo-scored"**, and "challenge" replaces "duel" throughout | "Solo-scored" describes gameplay but reads as contest size, and it caused exactly that misreading. "Duel" was also wrong against the codebase, which has a `Challenge` model, `/challenges` routes, a `challengesEnabled` flag and `challenge_entry` ledger entries. API field `supportsDuel` became `supportsOneVsOne` - free to change while no provider is signed |
| 30 Aug 2026 | **Game Masters get their own chapter, `19`** | An earlier draft called them "four smaller items, three to four days". The real system is three collections, 28 routes, a tier economy, a referral chain, a renewal worker job and two earning paths. The real figure is ~2.5 weeks, and one item inside it is a gate |
| 30 Aug 2026 | **Game Masters may not create provider contests at launch** - `limits.allowedGameTypes` defaults to `["trading"]` | A provider charges per round; the Game Master share is a percentage of the entry fee taken **before** that cost, and the existing cap is against **gross** platform fee. A popular low-fee contest can therefore be net loss-making while still paying the Game Master. They still **earn** from referred players in provider contests from day one - only creation is gated. Revisit once the share is computed on net fee after provider cost. `19` section 5 |

## OPEN QUESTIONS

| # | Question | Owner | Needed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Add-on or external-only?** See the decision box at the top | **Owner** | **Before any engineering** |
| 1 | Which provider? | Commercial | Before E3 / X4 |
| 2 | Pricing model, and cost per round? | Commercial | Before E3 / X4 - it decides whether cheap contests are viable |
| 3 | Are practice rounds billed? | Commercial | Before E6 / X7 |
| 4 | Which games first - trivia, chess puzzles, word? | Product | Before E5 / X6 |
| 5 | Default entry fee band for provider contests? | Product | Before E9 / X12 |
| 6 | Who bears the cost of an incorrect payout caused by a provider defect? | Legal | Before contract signature |
| 7 | Data processing agreement terms and hosting locations? | Legal | Before any real player identifier is sent |

### Additional questions raised by the external-only scenario

| # | Question | Owner | Needed by | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | Is there a **committed date** for sandbox access, not just a promise? | Commercial | Before X1 starts - five weeks of work is blocked on it | **X1** |
| 9 | Will a **second provider** be evaluated before public launch, even if only one goes live? | Commercial | Before X12 | **X2**, **X6** |
| 10 | Is a small **in-house insurance game** worth keeping on the backlog as a hedge? See `10` section 5 | Owner | Before X12 | **X2** |
| 11 | How is the **Game Master revenue share** calculated when a provider charges per round? | Product | Before Game Masters touch provider games. Default: exclude them | `16` s3 |
| 12 | Does the provider's catalogue justify pulling the **games catalogue (X11)** forward? Ten titles at once changes the answer | Product | After the first catalogue sync | `16` s1 |

Carried over from the `New games plan` tracker and still current.

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| App is live | https://chartvolt.com/ - real users, real money |
| Database | MongoDB Atlas (`mongodb+srv`) |
| Local database | `chatvolt` - development only, confirmed **not** production |

## RELATIONSHIP TO THE `New games plan` FOLDER

Depends on which scenario is chosen.

### Add-on - complementary, with a one-way dependency

```
Stage 0  - prerequisite defect fixes        (New games plan 00a)
   |
Phase 1  - game module foundation           (New games plan P1)   REQUIRED BY BOTH
   |
   +--> in-house game module (Trivia)       (New games plan P2)
   |
   +--> external provider module            (THIS PLAN, E1-E9)
```

This plan **replaces the first proof game** rather than the architecture. Nothing here
reduces the need for Stage 0 or Phase 1.

### External-only - this folder stands alone

```
X0  Stage 0 defect fixes         (still required - New games plan 00a)
 |
X1  Foundation, four seams       (THIS FOLDER, ch. 11 - was New games plan P1)
 |
X2..X5  Provider integration     (THIS FOLDER, ch. 09 E1-E4)
 |
X6..X8  Admin, UI, wording,      (THIS FOLDER, ch. 12-15 - was New games plan P3-P5)
        flags, infrastructure
 |
X9..X12 Resilience, challenges,       (THIS FOLDER, ch. 09 E7-E9 + ch. 16 + ch. 18)
        catalogue, pilot
```

The `New games plan` then becomes **reference material rather than a dependency** - its
audit and architecture chapters remain the fuller treatment of the codebase, and `00a`
remains the authoritative Stage 0 specification. Chapters `10`-`18` here restate what is
needed rather than duplicating the whole thing, and cross-reference the source where the
detail lives.

**In both scenarios, Stage 0 comes first and needs owner sign-off.**

### 1 Sep 2026 - X0 started in the other folder; four restated facts corrected - DOCUMENTED

**Trigger:** the owner started Stage 0 / X0. Re-verifying the two defects before touching
code corrected several facts this folder **restates** from the `New games plan`, which the
sync rule requires propagating rather than leaving to diverge.

**Shipped:** nothing from this folder. No provider work has begun and no scenario has been
chosen. One live security fix shipped from the Stage 0 work - commit `d5d3a328`, simulator
route authentication - recorded here only because the class of defect applies to the
provider webhook this plan specifies.

**Facts corrected (all were restatements of `New games plan` sources):**

| Was | Is |
|---|---|
| ~21 mirrored files, 3 drifted | **75 mirrored model files, 11 drifted.** Plus 19 action and 51 service files duplicated. There were also **112 stale committed declaration files** (57 `.d.ts` + 55 `.d.ts.map`) - all deleted 1 Sep 2026, and never a real third copy since TypeScript ignored them |
| Mirror drift means "the admin cannot see the field" | **Wrong as stated, measured 1 Sep 2026.** `.lean()` and `toObject()` do not hide the field, and an ordinary `save()` does not strip it. Drift is **write-side**: a missing *enum value* rejects the write outright, and the narrower app cannot write the field at all - silently, while reporting success. The one exception is real and severe: **ordinary `doc.field` access reads `undefined`**, which is how three admin routes lost the ability to restore branding images after a redeploy |
| The finalize-time safeguard masks the prize-pool gap | It does **not**. It only fires when the pool is too *high*, so an under-counted pool is under-distributed with no correction and no log |
| Two competition join paths | **Four** entry writers, one of which has no callers. Also the challenge *accept* path skips restriction and fraud checks, on a route real players use |
| Stage 0 is 5-8 days | **6-9 days** |

**Files touched:** `17-risk-register.md` - R1 and R2 rewritten, **R27 added** for the
header-as-authentication defect with the two rules it implies for the provider callback
(never accept a request because configuration is missing; test the route, not just the
helper). `18-migration-testing-rollout.md` section 2 - real mirror counts, the enum-value
requirement, the allowlist requirement, the add-only rule, and the fact that the husky
`pre-push` hook does not exist yet. This file - status, both phase tables, this entry.

**Deviated from plan:** X0's estimate rose by a day, and X0 is no longer purely inherited
from the other folder - it now contains a shipped item that was never planned.

**Owner tested:** nothing yet. `d5d3a328` needs deploying first.

**Deferred:** everything in this folder, unchanged. The scenario decision is still open and
is still the thing that gates all of it.

**Next chat should:** ignore this folder and continue X0 in `New games plan/PROGRESS.md`,
starting with the test-database decision and then Defect 2. Come back here only when the
scenario decision is made.

### 30 Aug 2026 - Contest formats clarified, Game Masters given a chapter - DOCUMENTED

**Trigger:** the owner read "solo-scored" as "solo contest" and asked for competitions with
two or more players sharing a pool, challenges one against one, and Game Masters working on
the new games exactly as they do for trading.

**The first half was a naming failure, not a design gap.** The plan already had exactly the
two formats asked for. "Solo-scored" described *gameplay* - each player plays their own
round rather than needing a live opponent - and was read as *contest size*. The clearest
demonstration that these are different things: **trading is itself an independent-play
game.** Every trader trades their own account, alone, and they are all ranked against each
other for a share of one pool.

**Renamed throughout, 80 lines across 18 files:**

| Old | New | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `solo_scored` / "solo-scored" | `independent` / "independent play" | "Solo" caused the misreading |
| "duel" | "challenge" | The codebase has a `Challenge` model, `/challenges` routes, `challengesEnabled`, `challenge_entry` and `challenge_refund` ledger entries. "Duel" existed nowhere in the product and `04` even described a non-existent "Duel model" |
| `supportsDuel` | `supportsOneVsOne` | Provider-facing field. Free to change while no provider is signed |
| `03-competition-and-duel-flows.md` | `03-competition-and-challenge-flows.md` | Filename followed |

**New content:**

- **`03` section 0, before anything else** - no paid format is ever single-player.
  Competition means two or more, challenge means exactly two, practice is the only
  one-player mode and it is free and unranked. Cites the existing `minParticipants` default
  of 2 and the existing auto-cancel-and-refund at `competition.actions.ts` lines 71-134, so
  this is **reused rather than built**
- **`03` section 1.4** - separates minimum *players* from minimum *play*, and adds the edge
  case neither covers: three join, one plays. Two policies, both on existing money paths
- **`19-game-masters.md`, new chapter** - see below
- `00-README.md` - an "independent play is about gameplay, not contest size" section

**Game Masters were badly under-scoped.** `16` section 3 called them "four smaller items,
roughly three to four days". Verified against the code, the system is three dedicated
collections, 28 API routes, three subscription tiers, a referral attribution chain, a daily
renewal worker job and **two separate earning paths** at competition and challenge
finalization. `19` replaces that section. Real figure **~2.5 weeks**, distributed through
X1, X6, X7 and X8 rather than being its own phase.

**Three findings from reading the code that the plan did not have:**

1. **A Game Master earns from referred players' entry fees in any contest, not from
   contests they created.** Creating competitions is how they attract referred players; it
   is not the revenue event. A plan built on the opposite assumption would have been wrong
   throughout
2. **`app/api/gamemaster/competitions/route.ts` inserts with the raw MongoDB driver and
   sets no game label** (lines 170-466). This is risk R7, and this is where it bites: an
   unlabelled competition reads as trading and gets settled by trading code, paying the
   wrong players. Promoted to a **gate inside X1**, not a task
3. **`apps/admin/lib/actions/trading/competition-end.actions.ts` has no Game Master
   earnings logic at all** - only `isGmCreated` on platform-fee recording at line 709. A
   competition finalized through the admin app pays **no Game Master earnings**. A live
   defect, unrelated to this project, now recorded

**And one genuinely new commercial problem, `19` section 5.** A provider charges per round;
the Game Master share is a percentage of the **entry fee** taken before that cost exists;
and the existing cap is against **gross** platform fee. Worked example: 20 players at 1.00,
10% tier, 2c per round - platform fee 2.00, Game Master share 2.00, provider cost 0.40,
**platform result -0.40**. Trading never had this because a trading round costs nothing.
Decision recorded: `limits.allowedGameTypes` defaults to `["trading"]`, so Game Masters
**earn** from provider contests immediately but cannot **create** one until the share is
computed on net fee after provider cost.

**Totals revised: 20-26 weeks, from 18-24.** X1 to 2.5-3.5, X6 to 3-3.5, X7 to 3-4. Also
separated engineering from calendar on the shortest useful path - nine to eleven weeks of
engineering, 11-14 in calendar terms, because X4 onward waits on sandbox access. The old
figure conflated the two.

**Files touched:** all 19 chapters plus `PROGRESS.md`, both HTML documents, and
`.cursor/rules/games-plan-docs-sync.mdc`.

**Next chat should:** still answer open question 0 - add-on or external-only. Nothing here
changes that decision; it makes the external-only figure honest.

### 30 Aug 2026 - Folder made self-contained for the external-only scenario - DOCUMENTED

**Shipped:** nine new chapters, `10` to `18`. Chapters `01`-`09` were written assuming the
`New games plan` delivers Stage 0, the game-module foundation, an in-house proof game and
every platform-wide change. If provider games are the **only** new games, that assumption
fails and the dependency moves into this folder. It now lives here:

- `10-external-only-programme.md` - scenario definition, what genuinely changes, the
  self-contained **X0-X12** plan (20-26 weeks), the shortest useful path (X0-X5 plus a
  minimal X6, 11-14 weeks), six scenario-specific risks, and what is lost by having no
  in-house game
- `11-foundation-and-seams.md` - the four seams, all five finalization entry points, the
  game-module contract, seven architectural invariants, and the historical-competition
  regression test that proves trading is unchanged. Absorbs `New games plan` P1
- `12-admin-panel-plan.md` - navigation, RBAC (including the 8 existing omissions),
  `configSchema`-driven create wizard, analytics by game **and provider**, the new Game
  Performance screen, settings
- `13-user-ui-and-routes.md` - the `/play` dispatcher, the six trading providers that must
  stay scoped, the component move, dashboard, leaderboard, results, help, navigation
- `14-terminology-and-wording.md` - the terminology layer, eleven migration passes, and the
  ten categories of identifier that must never be renamed
- `15-infrastructure-jobs-and-flags.md` - the flag set, ten enforcement layers for
  `tradingEnabled`, price-feed gating, job changes, the dead Inngest crons, observability
- `16-games-catalogue-and-marketplace.md` - the three-way distinction between module,
  provider game and catalogue entry; sync-must-not-overwrite-admin-content; the
  no-pay-to-win rule and its consequence for provider selection; the Game Master
  provider-cost problem
- `17-risk-register.md` - R-series platform risks and **X-series scenario risks**, with
  three gates
- `18-migration-testing-rollout.md` - four backfills, eight test tiers (including a
  **contract tier** unique to this scenario), thirteen rollout steps, rollback per phase

**The finding worth recording:** external-only is **not cheaper**. Dropping the in-house
game saves ~3.5 weeks; a correct provider integration costs ~7; every platform-wide change
is identical either way. 20-26 weeks against 12-17. It buys breadth and removes the content
burden - and it adds a single supplier to the critical path with no fallback game.

**Also updated:** `00-README.md` gains a scenario-selection section at the top, the
extended index, and revised honest-assessment rows. `09-implementation-phases.md` is now
explicitly labelled as the add-on plan and points at `10` section 3. `PROGRESS.md` gains
the open scenario decision, an X-phase status table, five new decisions, five new open
questions, and the revised relationship diagram.

**Deviated from plan:** `10`-`18` cross-reference the `New games plan` chapters rather than
duplicating them wholesale, so the codebase audit does not exist twice and drift twice.
Where a fact is load-bearing - line numbers, the five finalization entry points, the eight
missing RBAC IDs - it is restated here so this folder is readable on its own.

**Owner tested:** N/A - documentation only. No application code changed.

**Deferred:** the illustrated HTML has a summary of the external-only scenario, not full
diagrams for each of the nine new chapters. If external-only becomes the decision, the HTML
deserves the same diagram treatment `01`-`09` received.

**Next chat should:** get the scenario decision recorded at the top of this file. It changes
the programme from 8 weeks to 24, so nothing else should be planned until it is answered.

### 30 Aug 2026 - Games-first direction applied to the provider contract - DOCUMENTED

**Shipped:** the owner's games-first direction (recorded in
`../New games plan/15-platform-transformation-and-gaps.md`) has one concrete
consequence for this plan: every provider title becomes a **catalogue entry with its
own page**, so the provider must supply page-quality content, not just a name and a
thumbnail. Propagated:

- `01-provider-contract-specification.md` - new **section 3.1 "Presentation content"**.
  `tagline`, `description`, `rulesSummary`, `howToPlay` and `bannerUrl` promoted from
  optional to **required**; `iconUrl`, `tags` and `screenshotUrls` added. Three
  constraints stated: localised into every declared locale, no provider branding in
  copy, stable cacheable HTTPS asset URLs. Score-affecting in-game purchases declared
  out of scope entirely
- `ChartVolt-Game-API-Requirements.html` - **bumped to version 1.1** with a document
  history table. Same content fields, artwork minimums, the "why we ask for real page
  content" rationale, the no-pay-to-win rule as a conversation-ender, two new
  conformance items, three new product questions and one new commercial question
  (commercial list renumbered from 21, and the pricing callout updated to match)
- `ChartVolt-External-Games-Plan.html` - new "Where a provider game appears to players"
  block in the architecture section

**Deviated from plan:** none. This tightens the provider contract rather than changing
the architecture.

**Owner tested:** N/A - documentation only.

**Deferred:** nothing.

**Next chat should:** unchanged - Stage 0 and Phase 1 in `New games plan` remain the
gate. On the commercial track, the provider questionnaire is now longer and better;
version 1.1 of the requirements HTML is the file to send out.

---

### 18 Aug 2026 - Planning - COMPLETE

**Shipped:** Ten planning documents plus an illustrated HTML version. No application
code changed.

**Deviated from plan:** Written provider-neutral rather than against any specific
candidate, so that `01-provider-contract-specification.md` serves as both our
requirements document and the checklist we assess candidates against.

**Owner tested:** N/A.

**Deferred:** All implementation, and provider selection.

**Next chat should:** Do nothing in code. If the owner wants to progress this, the
next step is **Track A** - send Gate 1 of `08` to candidate providers. Engineering
cannot usefully start until Stage 0 and Phase 1 of the `New games plan` are done.
